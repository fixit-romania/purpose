# purpose

My purpose is to motivate developers to serve Romania with their skills - for free... I mean - we'll be payed for our work with countless hours we can save for ourselves and our peers when we won't need to wait at different offices for things that could be solved online.

It all started with this thread https://twitter.com/radubrehar/status/1238569771983089676
Why do we have to get here in order for things to be moved online? We can help make the transition faster!

## discussions

Let's use issues in this repo for general purpose discussions and proposals - how to organize, tools to use, project ideas, etc.

## language

Both Enlish and Romanian are fine.
Se poate folosi atÃ¢t limba englezÄƒ cÃ¢t È™i limba romÃ¢nÄƒ.

### end

So, let's fix IT in Romania ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ğŸ”§. Together, we can do it.ğŸ™Œ
