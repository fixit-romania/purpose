# purpose

My purpose is to motivate developers to serve Romania with their skills - for free... I mean - we'll be payed for our work with countless hours we can save for ourselves and our peers when we won't need to wait at different offices for things that could be solved online.

So, let's fix IT in Romania ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ğŸ”§. Together, we can do it.ğŸ™Œ
