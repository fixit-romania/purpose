# purpose

My purpose is to motivate developers to serve Romania with their skills - for free... I mean - we'll be payed for our work with countless hours we can save for ourselves and our peers when we won't need to wait at different offices for things that could be solved online.

It all started with this thread https://twitter.com/radubrehar/status/1238569771983089676
Why do we have to get here in order for things to be moved online? We can help make the transition faster!

So, let's fix IT in Romania ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ðŸ”§. Together, we can do it.ðŸ™Œ
